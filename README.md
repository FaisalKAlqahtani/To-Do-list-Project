# To-Do-list-Project

Patch Notes 1.1

Scraped my old Project and started from the scratch. 
Why you may ask?
Because I want to try new methods and learn new techniques in order to think as a develober even if it didn't work

My main core functions are:-
Used SqlLite as my Database instead of Room
Used RecyclerView instead of Fragments 
Used a modern, cleaner looking layout instead of my old one
I think I am the first student to use splash out screen

What am I missing?
a few tweeks on the database interaction and access values 
fixing the crash when clicking on the task

Everything else should work flawlessly 

A feedback is appreciated :)
