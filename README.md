## :scroll: Description
---
I made a ToDo List using Kotlin in Android Studio, for the database I used SQLite Database instead of Room. 
Because I was curiuos about SQLite and wanted to learn it and apply it.

Some of the features on my App are:-
- I used RecyclerView and SQLite Database as my core
- Opening animations.
- Item descreption is seperate instead of mashed together with task title.
- The ability to add, edit, and delete tasks and items too.
- The ability to mark up all item tasks or some or even resetting them all.
- Cleaner and more modern looking layout.
- And most immportatly items are DRAGGABLE!!


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
---
To learn unlearn and relearn. That is why I try to push myself to the limit and try new databases, animations and even complicated layout designs. 

Why? To DISTINGUISH myself from other extremely talanted trainees. I am here to make mistakes and learn from them, 

sacrifice perfection to deliver before due time(Applying Agile SCRUM Method). 

Basically, I try to act as developer while working as a student, because in the end it is a learning process.
